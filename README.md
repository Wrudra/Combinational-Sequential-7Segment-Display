# 7-Segment-Display-Circuit-DL2-31D230S12

This project involves designing a combinational and sequential circuit to display "DL2-31D230S12" on a 7-segment display. It combines digital logic concepts, including the use of multiplexers and optimized flip-flops for efficient implementation.

## Key Components
- **Combinational Circuit**: Handles the static segments using simplified logic expressions derived from K-maps.
- **Sequential Circuit**: Utilizes J-K flip-flops for state transitions and a 555 timer for timing control.
- **Simulations**: Verified using Logisim to ensure accurate display and performance.

## Running the Simulations
- The provided `.circ` files can be opened and run using [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), allowing you to observe the display and circuit functionality in action.
